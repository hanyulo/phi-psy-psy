# Bend Their Reality


## negotiation
* is not linear
    * notice the irrational blind spots, hidden needs and undeveloped notions
        * unspoken needs and thoughts
* goal: bend counterpart's reality so it conforms to what we ultimately want to give them, not to what they initially think they deserve


## note
* **no deal is better than bad deal (compromise)**
    * compromise === mismatched shoes
        * one brown and one black

* never split the difference
    * embrace risk, annoyance, confusion


## Deadlines: make time your ally
* deadline
    * deadline make people feel doing a deal now is more important than getting a good deal
    * anxiety
        * consequence: the deal is off
    * in fact, the deadline usually hardly ever trigger consequences we think or are told
* patience is formidable weapon


## note
* figure hidden self-imposed deadline
    * kidnappers want to get money before Friday so that they can party on weekend

* reveal your deadline to your counterpart?
    * old school thought
        * never reveal your deadline because your counterpart may sign the deal in the last minute to push you to make concessions
            * theory flaw: you may just drop the deal which also hurts your counter part
   * latest thought
        * you should reveal your deadline
            * avoid impasses
            * sign the deal more quickly and in more efficient way
                * you counterpart: concession-making
        * keep in mind: deadline is not ironclad


## No Such Thing As Fair
* "If you approach a negotiation thinking that the other guy thinks like you, you're wrong, that is not empathy; thats projection"

* we usually making decision by emotion not logic
    * 10$ test

## The F-word(Fiar) Why it's so powerful, when to use it, and how
* Ultimatum Game: Most people make an irrational choice to let the dollar slip through their fingers rather than to accept a derisory offer, because the negative emotional value of unfairness outweighs the positive rational value of the money

* the pursue of fairness is emotional not logical
    * Iran pursue nuclear development and lost the money from imposed sanction on oil business


* sentences
    * "we just want what's fair"
    * "We have given you a fair offer"

* how to use it:
    * say it at start
        * "I want you to feel like you are being treating fairly at all times"

## How to get discover the emotional drivers behind that the other party values
* know the emotional drivers and you can frame the benefits of any deal in language that will resonate

## Behind the Reality
* different perspectives change view of fairness
    * A offer B 20$ to run errands (5 minutes)
        * B feels thrilled
        * once B know that A make 50 millions for the errand then B feels being ripped off.

* Loss Aversion
    * people will take greater risks to avoid losses than to achieve gains
        * example
            * 95 % change of losing 10,000 > 100 % of losing 9,499

* Certainty Effect
    * people are drawn to sure things over probabilities, even when the probability is a better choice.
        * Example
            * 95 % chance of receiving 10,000 < 100% change of getting 9,499

* steps (bend the reality)
1. Anchor Their Emotions
    * need empathy
    1. accusation audit
        * acknowledges counterparts's fear
    2. enable loss aversion
    * example: p. 348
        *

2. Let the other guy go first
3. Establish a range
    * taget: 110,000
    * require: 130,000 - 170,000
    * a range makes 130,000 seems less enough to pay

4. Pivot to nonmonetary terms

* example
    * A: provide training service which charge 25, 000 a day
        * B: magazine company which thinks the price is too high
            * lower price + magazine cover -> deal!!

    * note
        * to B, the magazine cover cost 0$
        * to A, this is valuable advertisement
5. When you do talk numbers, use odd ones
* 37,263 is better than 37,000

6. Surprise with a gift
    1. stake an extreme anchor that your counter part will reject inevitable
    2. offer them a wholly unrelated surprise gift.
    * note: Unexpected conciliatory gestures like this are hugely effective because they introduce a dynamic called reciprocity


## Example
* hostage price negotiation
    * price: 150,000
    * target: 5, 000

* steps (p.364)
    1. say no without saying no
        * anchor that you don't have money
            * "How can I come with that kind of money?"
                * open end question
    2. trigger fairness
        * "how are we supposed to pay if you're going to hurt her?"
    3. offer extreme low anchor
        * 3,000
    4. offer odd numbers
        * 4,751
    5. offer off numbers + nonmonetary item
        * 4,751 + portable CD stereo


## Negotiate a better salary
* get higher salary
    * be pleasant persistence
    * ask about non-salary terms
* define your success metrics
    * definer what you want
* Spark their interest in your success
    * bend interviewer's reality so that he/she will believe recruit you will be their own interest to show that they are good at selecting people
        * example:
            * "ask how to become success in the role?"
            * "what does it take to be successful to be here"
                * get a free mentor

* tips
    * ask about non-monetary terms and wait for the counter part to talk first
    * anchor their emotion first
    * create empathy
    * odd number, range
    * request fairness
    *
