* queries that other side can respond to but that have no fixed answers
* buys you time
* Gives your counterpart the illusion of control
    * They are the one with answer but actually being constrained
* passive aggressive
* example
    * how am I suppose to do that ?


## Getting to Yes
* negotiate logically
1. separate the person -- the emotion -- from the problem
2. Don't get wrapped up in the other side's position (what they're asking for) but instead focus on their interests (why they're asking for it) so you can find what they really want
3. work cooperatively to generate win-win options
4. establish mutually agreed-upon standards for evaluating those possible solutions
