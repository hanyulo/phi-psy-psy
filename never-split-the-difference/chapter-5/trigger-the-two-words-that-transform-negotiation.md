## Behavioral Change Stairway Model (BCSM)
* five stages
    1. active listening
    2. empathy
    3. rapport
    4. influence
    5. behavioral change

* goal
    * establish unconditional positive regard
    * you can begin exert influence
    * get two words not just plain "Yes"
        * "That's right"

* founder: Carl Rogers (psychologist)

* majority believe
    * love, praise, approval are dependent on saying and doing the things people consider correct
        * habit: hide what we really want (to say)
    * result
        * hard to change people's behavior


## Create A Subtitle Epiphany
* Christopher try to convince Benji (Philipine Police Head) to estalish a rapport-based relationship with Sabaya
    * C: "You hate Sabaya, don't you?" (label)
    * B: "I tell you I do!!!" (=== That's right)
        * rage -> calm -> think logically


## Trigger A "That's Right" With a Summary
* active listening
    1. Effective Pause
        * Silence
            * drain emotion from the dialogue
            * let your counterpart talks more
    2. Minimal Encouragers
        * simple phase to shoe you are paying full attention: "Yes"  "OK" "Uh-huh" "I see"
    3. Mirroring
        * listen and repeat back what your counterpart said
        * don't argue
    4. Labeling
        * identify and name the counterpart's feeling
            * "It all seems so tragically unfair, I can now see why you sound so angry"
    5. Paraphrase
        * Repeat what your counterpart's sentence in your own words
            * show that you really understand your counterpart
    6. Summarize
        * (paraphrasing + labeling) -> get a "That's Right"
        * refelct conterpart's vision

* once get that's right
    * the whole negotiation will go to different direction
    * counterpart assessed why you've said and fully embrace it.
